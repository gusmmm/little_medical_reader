# Little Medical Reader

This app helps you read your patient's notes by converting the content to a visual format after extracting the data.

## Features

The Little Medical Reader is designed to work with patient notes in three formats:
- **PDF** - The app will convert it to markdown
- **Markdown** - Direct processing
- **Text** - Direct processing

The app features a graphical interface built with Streamlit and will use workflow chains with LLM and AI agents powered by LangChain.

## Current Implementation

The current version of the app includes:

### âœ… Implemented Features
- **PDF Upload Interface**: Upload PDF medical documents through a user-friendly Streamlit interface
- **PDF Page Extraction**: Extract all pages from PDF files as images using pdfplumber
- **Image Display**: View extracted pages as images in the web interface
- **Session State Management**: Maintain extracted pages in session state for persistent viewing
- **Responsive Layout**: Two-column layout with file upload on the left and content display
- **Progress Indicators**: Loading spinners and success messages for user feedback
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring

### ðŸš§ Planned Features
- PDF to Markdown conversion
- Text and Markdown file processing
- LLM integration with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Local model support with Ollama
- AI-powered content analysis and visualization
- Workflow chains using LangChain

## Installation

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- uv package manager

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd little_medical_reader
```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will install all required dependencies including:
- `streamlit` - Web framework for the UI
- `pdfplumber` - PDF processing and text extraction

## Running the Application

### Start the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit application using uv:

```bash
uv run streamlit run UI/main.py
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:8501` by default.

### Alternative Method

You can also activate the virtual environment and run streamlit directly:

```bash
uv shell
streamlit run UI/main.py
```

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF**: Use the file uploader in the left column to select a PDF medical document
2. **View Pages**: Once uploaded, the app will extract all pages as images and display them
3. **Browse Content**: Scroll through the extracted pages to review the medical document content
