## Running the Application

### Start the V2 Application

To run the Little Medical Reader V2 using the smart entry point:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This will automatically:
- Launch the V2 Streamlit application with advanced features
- Find an available port (starting from 8501, scanning up to 8510 if needed)
- Display the exact URL where the app is accessible
- Handle port conflicts gracefully with automatic fallback
- Provide comprehensive error handling and logging

The app will start and display something like:
```
üè• Welcome to Little Medical Reader V2!
üìÑ Advanced PDF processing for medical journal articles
--------------------------------------------------
üöÄ Launching Little Medical Reader V2...
üåê App will be available at: http://localhost:8501
```

If port 8501 is busy, you'll see:
```
üè• Welcome to Little Medical Reader V2!
üìÑ Advanced PDF processing for medical journal articles
--------------------------------------------------
üöÄ Launching Little Medical Reader V2...
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Port 8501 is busy, using port 8502 instead
üåê App will be available at: http://localhost:8502
```

### Alternative Methods

You can also run the application directly (though the main entry point is recommended):

```bash
uv run streamlit run V2/main.py
```

Or activate the virtual environment and run manually:

**Application Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check if uv is installed
uv --version

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Try running with verbose output
uv run main.py
```

**AI Features Not Working**: 
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
- Check internet connectivity for API access
- Verify API key has sufficient quota

**Medical Concepts Extraction Slow**:
- Large documents are processed in chunks with progress tracking
- Processing continues in background even when switching tabs
- Check logs for detailed progress information

**PDF Processing Errors**:
- Check that uploaded file is a valid PDF
- Ensure the PDF is not password-protected
- Check that the file size is reasonable (< 100MB recommended)
- Verify the PDF contains extractable text (not just scanned images)
- Ensure sufficient disk space for processing
- Review logs in `logs/` directory for detailed error information

**NLP Analysis Errors:**
- The application automatically downloads required NLTK data
- Ensure sufficient disk space for visualization generation
- Check logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed error information

**Performance Issues**:
- Large PDFs may take longer to process
- AI processing requires internet connectivity
- Medical concepts extraction is limited to 50 most relevant concepts for performance

### Log Analysis

Check the application logs for detailed troubleshooting information:
- Location: `logs/` directory (created automatically)
- Format: Timestamped entries with module identification and detailed context
- Levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR for different severity levels with comprehensive stack traces
