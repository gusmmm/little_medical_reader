# Little Medical Reader

This app helps you read your patient's notes by converting the content to a visual format after extracting the data, and provides AI-powered intelligent summarization and medical concepts extraction for healthcare professionals.

## Features

The Little Medical Reader is designed to work with patient notes in three formats:
- **PDF** - The app will convert it to markdown with structure preservation
- **Markdown** - Direct processing and analysis
- **Text** - Direct processing and analysis

The app features a graphical interface built with Streamlit, AI-powered document analysis using Google Gemini 2.0-flash, comprehensive medical concepts extraction for knowledge graphs, and detailed logging throughout the processing pipeline.

### Advanced AI Features

#### Medical Concepts Extraction
The AI system identifies and categorizes medical concepts according to a clinically-relevant taxonomy:

**Concept Types:**
- **Individual**: Specific entities (e.g., "acute myocardial infarction", "metformin 500mg")
- **Qualitative**: Classifications (e.g., "hypertension", "positive blood culture")
- **Comparative**: Comparisons (e.g., "worse than yesterday", "above normal range")
- **Quantitative**: Measurements (e.g., "blood pressure 140/90 mmHg", "hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL")

**Clinical Relationships:**
- Treatment relationships: treats, improves, worsens
- Causal relationships: causes, influences
- Diagnostic relationships: indicates, measures, diagnoses
- Structural relationships: is_part_of, associated_with

#### Intelligent Relevance Filtering
The system automatically prioritizes concepts using a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers:
- **Frequency in text** (30%): How often the concept appears
- **Clinical significance** (25%): Medical importance level
- **AI confidence** (20%): Extraction confidence score
- **Concept type priority** (15%): Clinical value of concept type
- **Category priority** (10%): Medical category importance

### Session Persistence

Your processed content remains available during your session, allowing you to:
