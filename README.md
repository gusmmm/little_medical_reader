# Little Medical Reader

This app helps you read your patient's notes by converting the content to a visual format after extracting the data, and provides AI-powered intelligent summarization for healthcare professionals.

## Features

The Little Medical Reader is designed to work with patient notes in three formats:
- **PDF** - The app will convert it to markdown with structure preservation
- **Markdown** - Direct processing and analysis
- **Text** - Direct processing and analysis

The app features a graphical interface built with Streamlit, AI-powered document analysis using Google Gemini 2.0-flash, and comprehensive logging throughout the processing pipeline.

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit application using uv:

```bash
uv run streamlit run UI/main.py
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:8501` by default.

### Alternative Method

You can also activate the virtual environment and run streamlit directly:

```bash
uv shell
streamlit run UI/main.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload a PDF**: Use the file uploader in the left column to select a PDF medical document
2. **Automatic Processing**: The app will automatically:
   - Extract all pages as images for visual inspection
   - Convert the PDF content to structured markdown format
   - Analyze document structure and preserve hierarchical elements
3. **View Content**: 
   - **Left Column**: Browse through extracted page images with adjustable zoom
   - **Right Column**: Access original markdown content and AI-generated summaries via tabs
4. **Generate AI Summary**: 
   - Click "Generate AI Summary" to create an intelligent analysis
   - View document type detection and medical specialty identification
   - Access structured summary appropriate for healthcare professionals
5. **Download Results**: Save both converted markdown files and AI summaries to your local machine

### AI Features

The AI summarization system provides:
- **Document Classification**: Automatic detection of document types (research papers, clinical notes, discharge summaries, etc.)
- **Specialty Recognition**: Identification of relevant medical specialties (cardiology, neurology, oncology, etc.)
- **Adaptive Summaries**: Different summary structures based on document type:
  - Research articles: Study overview, methodology, key findings, clinical implications
  - Clinical documents: Patient information, key findings, treatment plans, follow-up requirements
  - Case reports: Case presentation, clinical course, outcomes, learning points
- **Target Audience Optimization**: Summaries tailored for specific healthcare professional audiences

### Session Persistence

Your processed content remains available during your session, allowing you to:
- Switch between original content and AI summaries
- Regenerate summaries with different focus
- Download multiple versions of processed documents
